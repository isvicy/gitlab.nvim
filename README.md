To view these help docs and to get more detailed help information, please run `:h gitlab.nvim`

## Requirements

- <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> >= v1.19

## Quick Start

1. Install Go
2. Add configuration (see Installation section)
3. Run `:lua require("gitlab").choose_merge_request()` or `:lua require("gitlab").review()` if already in review branch/worktree.

This will checkout the branch locally, and open the plugin's reviewer pane.

For more detailed information about the Lua APIs please run `:h gitlab.nvim.api`

## Installation

With <a href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim">Lazy</a>:

```lua
{
  "harrisoncramer/gitlab.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
    "stevearc/dressing.nvim", -- Recommended but not required. Better UI for pickers.
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- Recommended but not required. Icons in discussion tree.
  },
  build = function () require("gitlab.server").build(true) end, -- Builds the Go binary
  config = function()
    require("gitlab").setup()
  end,
}
```

And with <a href="https://github.com/lewis6991/pckr.nvim">pckr.nvim</a>:

```lua
{
  "harrisoncramer/gitlab.nvim",
  requires = {
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
    "stevearc/dressing.nvim", -- Recommended but not required. Better UI for pickers.
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- Recommended but not required. Icons in discussion tree.
  },
  run = function() require("gitlab.server").build() end, -- Builds the Go binary
  config = function()
    require("diffview") -- We require some global state from diffview
    require("gitlab").setup()
  end,
}
```

Add `branch = "develop",` to your configuration if you want to use the (possibly unstable) development version of `gitlab.nvim`.

## Contributing

Contributions to the plugin are welcome. Please read [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start working on a pull request.

## Connecting to Gitlab

This plugin requires an <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token">auth token</a> to connect to Gitlab. The token can be set in the root directory of the project in a `.gitlab.nvim` environment file, or can be set via a shell environment variable called `GITLAB_TOKEN` instead. If both are present, the `.gitlab.nvim` file will take precedence.

Optionally provide a GITLAB_URL environment variable (or gitlab_url value in the `.gitlab.nvim` file) to connect to a self-hosted Gitlab instance. This is optional, use ONLY for self-hosted instances. Here's what they'd look like as environment variables:

```bash
export GITLAB_TOKEN="your_gitlab_token"
export GITLAB_URL="https://my-personal-gitlab-instance.com/"
```

And as a `.gitlab.nvim` file:

```
auth_token=your_gitlab_token
gitlab_url=https://my-personal-gitlab-instance.com/
```

The plugin will look for the `.gitlab.nvim` file in the root of the current project by default. However, you may provide a custom path to the configuration file via the `config_path` option. This must be an absolute path to the directory that holds your `.gitlab.nvim` file.

In case even more control over the auth config is needed, there is the possibility to override the `auth_provider` settings field. It should be
a function that returns the `token` as well as the `gitlab_url` value, and a nilable error. If the `gitlab_url` is `nil`, `https://gitlab.com` is used as default.

Here an example how to use a custom `auth_provider`:
```lua
require("gitlab").setup({
  auth_provider = function()
    return "my_token", "https://custom.gitlab.instance.url", nil
  end,
}
```

For more settings, please see `:h gitlab.nvim.connecting-to-gitlab`

## Configuring the Plugin

The plugin expects you to call `setup()` and pass in a table of options. All of these values are optional, and if you call this function with no values the defaults will be used.

For a list of all these settings please run `:h gitlab.nvim.configuring-the-plugin` which will show you the help stored in [doc/gitlab.nvim.txt](doc/gitlab.nvim.txt).

## Keybindings

The plugin sets up a number of useful keybindings in the special buffers it creates, and some global keybindings as well. Refer to the relevant section of the manual `:h gitlab.nvim.keybindings` for more details.

For more information about each of these commands, and about the APIs in general, run `:h gitlab.nvim.api`
